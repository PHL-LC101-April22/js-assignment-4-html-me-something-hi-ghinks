                     <h2>Strays</h2>
                  <p align="justify">I <i>used</i> to have beef with cats.<br><br>Once upon a time, a stray moved in underneath our house, birthed 5 kittens and slaughtered every birds and squirrel is could kill while leaving animal bits behind for us. Although I was perturbed by our new house guests, I like to think them not paying a single &cent; had more to do with it than the dead carcasses and destruction of our rose garden. <br><br>Years removed from their cinderblock eviction, I learned something fascinating about them that has me rethinking my actions...<br><br>According to my best friend, a longtime cat owner, you can leave them alone for <b>DAYS</b> (!) at a time and they will self-sustain. Thinking back, I should have <i>already</i> figured this out because duh, they were pretty sufficient under the house, but I digress... Why does this any of this matter? Well, it doesn't, but that self-sufficiency part is more than I can say for my two dogs. Dogs are needy. More needy than a newborn, and that's what makes them the "forever toddler."<br><br>So, if you are like me, and like to move freely around the world commitment free, don't get a pet. But if you are like my husband, and you must, make it a fish. </p>

                     <h2>Spaghetti</h2>
                     <p align="justify" class="funParagraph" id="testP">When I was younger, my favorite food was a spaghetti. Even at a young age, I knew all chefs weren't created equal - as far as I was concerned, mom made the best spaghetti on the planet - it was the only thing that I would order when we'd go out to eat.<br><br>As I matured, I thought that I would grow out of my love for spaghetti, but that never happened. In fact, my love for spaghetti grew and I became more passionate about making spaghetti just as good (if not better) than moms! Alas, after many hours in the kitchen, I perfected it...the perfect "spicy spaghetti" recipe. Then, one day, I invited people into my life. A family of my very own, who, in fact, did not share my same love of spaghetti. They would actually request it <b>NOT</b> to be made. Disgrace! Shame! I went from eating spicy spaghetti weekly, to quarterly, if I was lucky. <br><br>Moral of the story: Eating things you like is an act of self-love. Cook the food that feeds your soul. </p>

                     <a name="music"></a>
                     <h2>Music</h2>
                     <p align="justify">Smooth jazz. Pop. Holiday. Rap. R&B. Classical. Funk. Reggae. I have an electic taste in music. Whatever the vibe is seeking in the moment becomes the playlist that takes centerstage. <br><br>As a small child, I used to play the same cd on repeat during the Holidays. It's so fried into my brain that now, when I hear certain holiday songs in isolation, I am automatically expecting the next song to be that in the order from the cd. As a youth, my grandparents bought me a piano and an organ - I even took lessons for the latter. When I got my first radio, I would play "WDAS smooth jazz" station as I fell asleep. I remember J.Lo's "On the 6" album, oh &amp; Monica's "The first night" single being some of my first store buys. I recall when I met my husband, and he helped me understand all the reggae lyrics that soundtracked my teenage house parties, lyrics I had been making up for years. Or how the first dance with my father on my wedding day, was to a song we (read: "I") played on repeat many a roadtrip. Gosh, I love The Spinners. I think often about how I played music, out loud on my stereo at home, but now how my children listen to their exclusively in their headphones. <br><br>Music has taught me so much, but most importantly, never let your older sibling borrow your brand new Luda "Back for the first time" cd before you've given it a third spin, because you will never see it again.</p>
